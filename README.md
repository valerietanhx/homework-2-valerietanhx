# CS+SG Education Team: Homework 2

## Assignment

This was built as part of a homework assignment for [UNC's CS+SG Education Team](https://cssgunc.org/) The goal was to create a portfolio website with Next.js that also used the useState hook and some buttons.

I don't intend on using this as an actual personal website, but wanted to keep it here anyway as a good memory to look back on. I really enjoyed making it! Hope to improve my technical skills and build more interesting websites in the future :)
